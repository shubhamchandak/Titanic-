This is the Movie Recommendation Android Application - "Titanic".

Firebase has been used to integrate Google Sign-In and Email Sign-Up functionalities.

The App majorly uses TMBD Web Api to fetch the relevant information/detail for the movies.

The user has to rate any 5 movies of his choice and would be given recommendations based on his input. Apart from that it also showcases the list of popular as well as Intheater movies.

It follows Master-Detail Flow where clicking on a particular movie opens up the Movie Details Activity which shows all the information about the movie and the user can also be further redirected to the relevant IMDB & TMDB websites.

The app heavily follows guidelines given in the Material Design specifications.

Here is a Video for the complete UX flow experience - [Video Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-jl3CcjD3FtTENoazQ0Ty14anc/view)
